The .exe does not require Python or any import installs.



> ### If you want to use the .py version you must:
>> Download [Python 3.11.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
>>
>> In the Python installation you must click add python to PATH.
>> 
>> install the imports needed using pip install \[importname]
>>
>> look inside the python file using a text edit to see the imports for now, ill make automatic import install soon.

# EDIT THE CONFIG.JSON FILE BEFORE RUNNING!!!
