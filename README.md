**The .exe does not require Python or any import installs ()**

> ### If you want to use the .py version you must:
>> Download [Python 3.11.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
>>
>> In the Python installation you must click add python to PATH.
>> 
>> install the imports needed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) install \[importname]
>>
>> look inside the python file using a text editor to see the imports you need to download, ill make automatic import install soon.

# Setup
